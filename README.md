My Master thesis project is about "Unraveling the neural mechanisms of reasoning using fMRI"
To identify the brain part involving reasoning, an reasoning experiment were provided with subjects.
In the experiment, visual stimulations were presented with alithmetic problems and subjects made calculation according to the instructions.

The visual stimulation was generated using this program.
The level of complexity were considered because easy calculation don't require any reasoning effort.
